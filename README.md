# react-repo
simple react repo : with login form and profile contains user details ,  drag and droppable list of skills and is autosaved

# Redux / central store
I have not used / implemented Redux or any other central store since it would be an overkill

# Storage
Use of localStorage for storing and no api / server is present as of now .
Use of sessionStorage for implementing feature described below

# navigation to profile page
when user is logged in and browser is closed, then when any url of this domain (for dev build localhost:3000) is called it will be redirected to /profile page once then the navigation would be as expected and/or as routed

# VCS : Git vcs and Github repo
I have used both git and github vcs for not actual version controlling here in this project since I am the only contributor and doing multiple branches and managing its fetch-heads is kind of overkill for this simple app. So just used it as a CI/CD and github repo as staging / live server
